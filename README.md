# 🎯 Project Name: NodeRunner

## 📌 Overview

NodeRunner is a Unity-based hacking simulation mini-game inspired by fictional hacking systems found in games like *Dispatch*.  
The goal is to create an immersive, fast-paced hacking experience where players navigate through digital networks, solve puzzles, and avoid antivirus systems.

This project is developed as part of a school innovation assignment and focuses on creativity, game design, and technical implementation.

## 🎮 Project Goals

- Create an engaging hacking-style mini-game
- Simulate realistic-looking digital systems
- Develop puzzle-based gameplay mechanics
- Implement enemy AI in the form of antivirus programs
- Improve skills in Unity and C# development
- Deliver a complete playable prototype

## 🧠 Gameplay Concept

Players take on the role of a digital infiltrator navigating through a virtual network.

The main objectives are to:

- Navigate through a grid of connected nodes
- Reroute and manipulate network connections
- Reach the final node in each level
- Avoid detection by antivirus programs
- Complete objectives within time or security limits

The game is designed to feel intense and immersive without requiring real hacking knowledge.

## 📌 Project Scope

Within the scope of this project, the following aspects will be developed:

- A grid of interconnected nodes  
- Creating and rerouting node connections at specific locations based on required input  
- Defining a clear objective to reach the final node  
- A visual interface styled as a hacking tool  
- Mouse and keyboard interaction  
- Player feedback through animations, colors, and sound effects  
- Game logic that communicates successes and errors to the player

## 🧩 Technical Concepts & Techniques

The project will apply the following development techniques:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Composition using Unity’s component-based system  
- Event-driven programming  
- An antivirus algorithm that attempts to locate the player  
- Hitbox detection  
- Input handling  
- Game state management  
- Use of prefabs for nodes and connections  
- Small UI animations for visual feedback  

The UI design will be based on a 2D environment.
